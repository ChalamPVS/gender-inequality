# Stackoverflow'18 Survey Analysis - A deeper look into gender inequalities.

## Motivation
 The project is motivated to have a deeper look at the gender inequalities that exists specifically in the tech space. For this purpose, Stackoverflow's 2018 survey results are deeply analyzed. Although, may not be completely scientific, the analysis is aimed to have some understanding at the magnitude of inequalities between genders, and how they relate to economic factors of the country, if any.

## Summary of the Analysis

Specifically, we tried to answer the below given questions in the analysis:

**Question 1:** How does the gender imbalance vary with respect to countries? 

**Findings**: 
- The overall female representation is a mere ~6%
- Egypt, Argentian and Nigeria have the best female representation, and Italy, Slovenia and Lithuania the worst.
- Interestingly, there is no relation between GDP Per Capita and the percentage of women represented in the survey.


** Question 2:** How does salary vary across contries between genders?

**Findings**: 
    
- The overall (mean) salary imbalance stood at ~ $8200
- Malaysia, Belgium and Pakistan have the highest (positive) salary difference between female and male respondents, and Norway, South Africa and Austria the highest (negative) difference.
- Interestingly, there is no relation between GDP Per Capita and the salary difference between genders.

** Question 3:** How does ethical choices vary across genders? 

**Findings:**

- Males are more inclined to make unethical choices - almost twice as much as female percentage who would make this choice. Male - 4%, Female - 2.3%. However, overall, very few respondents said they would make unethical choices. 
- There is a significant difference in the percentage of respondents who would strongly stick to ethical standards between males and females (59% Male Vs. 67% Female).
- More percentage of males than females (36% Male vs. 30% Female) said their ethical choices "Depends on what (kind of unethical purpose/product) it is" before they make an ethical choice.
